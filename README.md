| getGroup.ts         | The provided code snippet exports a function "getGroup" that takes a string parameter and a function, "setInvalidSearch". The function calls two other helper functions, "getGroupbyChatId" and "getGroupByName", which return an "IGroup" object. If neither helper function yields a result, the setInvalidSearch function is called to handle the missing group. Ultimately, this function returns an "IGroup" object or undefined. | src/services/chats/getGroup.ts              |
| getChats.ts         | This code exports a function'getChats' that takes in various options like the account, pgpPrivateKey, chatId, threadHash and limit in order to retrieve a list of chats. If provided with a threadhash it retrieves details of the conversation and its message history. It then returns chatResponse, lastThreadHash, and lastListPresent variables for the fetched threads except when no conversation threads are available.        | src/services/chats/getChats.ts              |
| getGroupByName.ts   | The provided code snippet defines and exports a function'getGroupByName' which uses the PushProtocol API and provided configuration data to retrieve a specified group's information. The function returns a promise for an object conforming to an interface defining a group object (of type IGroup). The try...catch block ensures the function throws an error if an error occurs during execution.                                | src/services/chats/getGroupByName.ts        |
| getGroupByChatId.ts | The code imports the PushAPI and appConfig modules, and the IGroup type interface. The function getGroupbyChatId takes a chat ID argument, calls the PushAPI to get a group, and returns a Promise containing the retrieved group. If any errors occur, the function logs them and throws a new error with the error message.                                                                                                          | src/services/chats/getGroupByChatId.ts      |
| index.ts            | The code exports all functions and/or variables from the module named "getChats". This allows other modules to import and access all exports within "getChats".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | src/services/chats/index.ts                 |

The component takes in a single props parameter, creating a value object containing the state and setState derived from the useState hook and rendering it within the NavigationContext.Provider element. This allows for accessing the state and updating it across components within the app that are also subscribed to the created NavigationContext. | src/contexts/NavigationContext_old.js |
| NavigationContext.tsx    | The code exports a context provider for React applications, along with a context object that contains the initial state of null for navigationSetup and a callback function named setNavigationSetup, which sets the state for navigationSetup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | src/contexts/NavigationContext.tsx    |
|                          | Any child component inside this provider can access these values via the useContext hook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                       |
| AppContext.tsx           | This code defines a React AppContext and its provider component called AppContextProvider. It creates a state variable called web3NameList, using the useState hook, and provides it to the context via the provider component. This allows any nested component access to this global state variable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | src/contexts/AppContext.tsx           |
| NotificationContext.tsx  | The code snippet provides a NotificationContext object with its initial value and a setter function. It also defines a NotificationContextProvider component that is used to wrap other components as children and provides them with NotificationContext. The NotificationContext can be used to manage notifications and update their count within the wrapped components.                                                                                                                                                                                   | src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx  |
